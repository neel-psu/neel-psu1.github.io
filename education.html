                <p> I completed masters from Indian Institute of Space sciences and Technology in the aerospace domain. In this period of time, I was exposed to ML problems, i,e, application of 
		ML to fluid dynamics problem. After a year break due to COvID-19 outbreak, I joined as JRF at IIT Bombay for 3 month and moved to IIT KGP for further exploring the Data science domain.
		Finally, after completing 2 years of work as Research assistant, I got into Penn State.</p>
